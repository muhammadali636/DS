# CIS2520-F24-A2

# Part 1: Assignment

## Skill Focus
- **Graph Theory**: Understanding graph representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List).
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **File Handling**: Reading a graph from a file.
- **Memory Management**: Efficiently using dynamic memory in C (linked lists).
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Using arguments to pass file names.

## Objective
The goal is to write a C program that:
1. Reads a graph's adjacency matrix from a `.txt` file.
2. Provides options to display the graph's adjacency list, perform BFS, DFS, and find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
3. Ensures robust file handling, input validation, and proper memory management.

## Transactions
### Menu Options:
1. **Display Adjacency List**: Convert the adjacency matrix into an adjacency list and display the list for all vertices.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverse the graph using BFS starting from vertex 1.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverse the graph using DFS starting from vertex 1.
4. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Compute and display the shortest path from vertex 1 to all other vertices using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
5. **Exit**: Quit the program.

## Program Quit
The program should continue showing the menu after performing an action until the user selects the "Exit" option. Memory should be cleaned up before quitting.

## Files
Your project will consist of the following files:
1. **graph.h**: Header file containing function declarations and data structure definitions.
2. **main.c**: The main program that handles the menu, reads the graph from the file, and calls the appropriate functions.
3. **graph_functions.c**: File containing the implementations of the graph-related functions (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, adjacency list creation).
4. **Makefile**: Makefile for compiling your program.
5. **README.md**: A brief explanation of the project and instructions for compiling and running it.

## Compiling the program
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. In the directory where the assignment files are saved, type:
	make 
This will compile all necessary files into an executable.

2. To run the program type:
`./a4 example-graph.txt`

# Part 2: Assignment Guidelines

## General Requirements
1. Your program must accept the graph’s adjacency matrix file as a command-line argument.
    - Example: `./a4 example-graph.txt`
2. It should handle input errors gracefully (e.g., missing or unreadable files).
3. All graph operations (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s) should work on the adjacency list, not the matrix.
4. The program should return to the menu after each operation until the user chooses to exit.
5. Ensure proper memory management. Every dynamically allocated memory (nodes, lists, etc.) should be freed before exiting.

## File Structure
Your submission should contain the following files:

- **graph.h**: Header file containing function declarations and data structure definitions for the graph operations.
- **main.c**: The main program that handles the menu, reads the graph from the file, and calls the appropriate functions.
- **graph_functions.c**: File containing the implementations of the graph-related functions (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, adjacency list creation).
- **Makefile**: Makefile for compiling your program. It should compile `main.c` and `graph_functions.c` into a single executable.
- **README.md**: A brief explanation of the project, including instructions for compiling and running it.

### Documentation and Style
You will be graded on both the functionality and readability of your code. This includes:

- Comments:
Each file should start with a comment block containing your name, student ID, date, and the assignment name.
Every function should have a brief comment describing its purpose.
Add comments for any section of code where the functionality is not immediately apparent.

- Code Style: Follow proper indentation and code style conventions. Poor formatting will result in a deduction.

### README File Guidelines
- Use the README template provided for students.
- You can add additional information if needed, such as specific instructions or challenges faced during implementation.


### Submission and Error Handling
- Be sure to handle error conditions gracefully. 
- Any compilation errors or warnings will result in a mark deduction based on the severity of the issue.
- Style, documentation, and code organization will also contribute to your overall mark.

## #Instructor and TA support

You can email [cis2520@socs.uoguelph.ca](mailto:cis2520@socs.uoguelph.ca) which will reach the entire instructional team.  Any email sent to this address will be answered by the first member of the instructional team available to respond.  You will get a response within 24 hours, and probably sooner.  Note that staff are not generally available outside of daytime working hours (for this or any course), so it is in your interest to start work early so that if you have questions you can ask them in time to get a good response.

Additional support is available during lab times when teaching staff will be available to answer lab related questions and general questions if time permits.  Note that lab exercises are designed specifically to build your skills within the focus of current and upcoming assignments.
